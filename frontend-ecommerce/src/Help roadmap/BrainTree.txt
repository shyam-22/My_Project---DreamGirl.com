Finally we arrived to a point ....where we are going to implement payment gateway

And this is ine of the most important feature of any e-commerce application

I want best payment processing option available out there in market 

we have couple of option such as---> stripe, paper or braintree 

Braintree --> The best thing about Braintree supports paypal which is one of the most importantpart of yoyr E-com app


//If you have only credit card/debit card option ,,then you will loss lots of users 
  --->because of most of the user they want to use paypal

//Its not going to super complicated but,,,
//you can have take steps slowly---> if you  new to It


//i will see you in the next lecture

//Braintree setup frontend

#1. First we need to go---> Braintree.sandbox --->GO to ---> API
#2. Second we need to generate new API KEY......Delete old one
#3. third copy the ....Merchant ID, Merchant public Key, Merchant private key 
#4. fourth paste all credentials in backend---> .env file
#5. install Brintree package in tour node js project
#6. so now first thing we will be doing---> we will be generating a Token
        ----> we will create a route we can call----> braintree/getToken


//Braintree setup Backend
# Install Braintree in our node js....so that we can generate the token
 #1. generate the toke and give to the frontend
 #2. Go to backend --> Routes folder --> create new file as ->Braintree.js
 #3. so here we will have all the routes related to the braintree payment processing
 #4.
